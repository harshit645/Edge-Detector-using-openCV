# Edge-Detector-using-openCV
With the use of 2 libraries here #cv2 (Computer Vision) and #numpy we can detect all the edges of different objects of the image.#Edgedetection is done by using three methods #sobelmethod #laplacianmethod #cannymethod. Here we use only 2 methods #Laplacian and #Canny for determining the edges of different objects of the image.
